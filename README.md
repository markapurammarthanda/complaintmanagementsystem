# complaintmanagementsystem
It is a java project used to help citizens lodge their complaints in a effecient way.
 Cities often face issues like potholes, broken roads, and drainage problems
 that make daily life difficult. However, reporting these problems is not
 always easy, and fixing them can take a long time due to inefficient
 communication and lack of tracking. There is a need for a system that
 allows citizens to report issues easily and ensures that authorities can
 address them quickly and transparently.This gap is filled by our project urban report i.e complaint management system.
